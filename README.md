EJERCICIO PARA CLAVE_VALOR
In this notebook we worked making groups by keys and values. We used the RDD transformation Reduced by key, sort by key and we also used joins.

EJERCICIOV SENSORES
In this notebook we started uplouding a dataset. We also kept using lambda, count and filter transformation to create code. We ended up getting to know the difference between take and print to show up the results. 


EJERCICIO PARES 
The focus of this exercise was to understand the functionality of the function reduce by key. In the exercises we were able to compare sales from one year to a reduced amount of time (three months) and group the elements by their key.

QUIJOTE
In this notebook we learnt different ways to count the letters of the Quijote (which is oen of the most important literary Spanish works) through "count", "take" and "reduce".

DATAFRAME

RDD MARTES
In this notebook we worked with parallelize method and lambda function. After that we used different RDD transformations, such as map, flatmap, sample, union and filter.
