EJERCICIO PARA CLAVE_VALOR
In this notebook we worked making groups by keys and values. We used the functions Reduced by key, sort by key and we also used joins.

EJERCICIO SENSORES
In this notebook we started uplouding a dataset and finded out the difference between "take" and "print". 
We also kept using lambda function and "count" and "filter" methods to create code.
