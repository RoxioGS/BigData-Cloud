EJERCICIO PARA CLAVE_VALOR
In this notebook we worked making groups by keys and values. We used the functions Reduced by key, sort by key and we also used joins.

SENSORES
In this notebook we started uplouding a dataset. We also kept using lambda function and "count" and "filter" methods to create code, to end up finding out the difference between "take" and "print". 


EJERCICIO PARES 
The focus of this exercise was to understand the functionality of the function reduce by key. In the exercises we were able to compare sales from one year to a reduced amount of time (three months) and group the elements by their key.

QUIJOTE
In this notebook we learnt different ways to count the letters of the Quijote (which is oen of the most important literary Spanish works) through "count", "take" and "reduce" methods.
